What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars? The percentage of vine reviews that are 5 stars in 51.1% and the unpaid reviews had only 38.7% of 5 star reviews.
###### Summary
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement. another analysis could be looking at number of 1 to zero star reviews for paid.
Overall, the differences in number of 5 star reviews in the paid versus unpaid reviews is about 12.4% I wouldn't say that this alone means that there is a significant positivity bias for reviews. Although the number of reviews done from the vine program is not high and having over half those reviews be 5 stars does indicate to me that there is some bias. Another analysis that I preformed was the number of one star reviews. There is only one which indicates there is some bias.
